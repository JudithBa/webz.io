Asomption and corner cuts that was made-

1. The crawler continue to crawl the website even if the login failed
2. Due to time constraints, the implementation of a retry mechanism was not done.
3. I assumed that the main goal is to get as many posts as possible so that's why driver.set_page_load_timeout set to 1 min max.
4. each json file have the thread identity as a prefix
5. the website have cloudflare anti-bot protection so i use undetected web driver
6. some of the wait are greater then 3 sec because 3 sec want enough to load the page
